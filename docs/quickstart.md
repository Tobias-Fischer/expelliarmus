# Getting started

`expelliarmus` is a library that allows to decode binary files generated by [Prophesee](https://prophesee.ai) cameras to [NumPy structured arrays](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.rec.html). 

The `expelliarmus` API contains a single class called `Wizard`, that contains many methods to read a file all at once, in chunks of `chunk_size` events or in time windows of `time_window` milliseconds. There are also additional methods to save structured NumPy arrays to different Prophesee encoding formats. 

## Read a file

Let us download [this file](https://dataset.prophesee.ai/index.php/s/fB7xvMpE136yakl/download) from the Prophesee website. 


```python
from pathlib import Path
import requests

prophesee_url = "https://dataset.prophesee.ai/index.php/s/fB7xvMpE136yakl/download"
fpath = Path("./pedestrians.raw")

# Downloading the file if it is not available.
if not fpath.is_file():
    print("Downloading the file...", end=" ")
    open(fpath, 'wb').write(requests.get(prophesee_url).content)
    print("done!")
else:
    print("File already available.")
```

    Downloading the file... done!


The file that we downloaded is an EVT3 one; hence, we need to create a `Wizard` object choosing an `"evt3"` encoding.


```python
from expelliarmus import Wizard

wizard = Wizard(encoding="evt3")
```

The file to be read can be specified in three ways:
- passing the `fpath` argument to the `Wizard` constructor at object creation time.
- using the `set_file()` method.
- passing the file path to the `read()` method.
Let us use the second way.


```python
wizard.set_file(fpath)
```

Now we can use the `read()` method to read the binary file to a NumPy structured array. 


```python
arr = wizard.read()
print(f"First events encoded as (t, x, y, p): {arr[0]}")
print(f"Number of events: {len(arr)}.")
print(f"Sample duration: {(arr[-1]['t']-arr[0]['t'])//int(1e6)} s.")
```

    First events encoded as (t, x, y, p): (5840504, 707, 297, 0)
    Number of events: 39297796.
    Sample duration: 60 s.


## Reading in chunks

The file could be too large to be read all at once in an array; for this reason, `expelliarmus` provides two generator methods: `read_chunk()` and `read_time_window()`, to read a file in chunks of a `chunk_size` events or in time windows of `time_window` milliseconds, respectively. Let us start from the first method.


```python
chunk_size = 8192
wizard.set_chunk_size(chunk_size)

# Calling the generator once:
chunk = next(wizard.read_chunk())
print(f"Chunk length: {len(chunk)}.")
print(f"Chunk duration: {(chunk[-1]['t']-chunk[0]['t'])/1e3:.2f} ms.")
print(f"Chunk first event: {chunk[0]}.")
```

    Chunk length: 8192.
    Chunk duration: 154.27 ms.
    Chunk first event: (5840504, 707, 297, 0).


Let us try to read a `time_window` milliseconds window from the file:


```python
time_window = 5
wizard.set_time_window(time_window)

# Calling the generator once.
chunk = next(wizard.read_time_window())
print(f"Chunk length: {len(chunk)}.")
print(f"Chunk duration: {(chunk[-1]['t']-chunk[0]['t'])/(1e3):.2f} ms.")
print(f"Chunk first event: {chunk[0]}.")
```

    Chunk length: 47.
    Chunk duration: 4.50 ms.
    Chunk first event: (5840504, 707, 297, 0).


## Conversion among file formats

Suppose that you have a really large file encoded in DAT, like [this one](https://dataset.prophesee.ai/index.php/s/YAri3vpPZHhEZfc/download). You might want to convert it to EVT2 to save disk space and have better read performance. `expelliarmus` allows you to do that. Let us download the file first. 


```python
prophesee_url = "https://dataset.prophesee.ai/index.php/s/YAri3vpPZHhEZfc/download"
fpath = Path("./spinner.dat")

# Downloading the file if it is not available.
if not fpath.is_file():
    print("Downloading the file...", end=" ")
    open(fpath, 'wb').write(requests.get(prophesee_url).content)
    print("done!")
else:
    print("File already available.")
```

    Downloading the file... done!


First we change `wizard` encoding and, then, we read the DAT file to an array.


```python
wizard.set_encoding("dat")
arr = wizard.read(fpath)

print(f"Sample encoded as (t, x, y, p): {arr[0]}")
print(f"Number of events: {len(arr)}.")
print(f"Sample duration: {(arr[-1]['t']-arr[0]['t'])/1e6:.2f} s.")
```

    Sample encoded as (t, x, y, p): (0, 237, 121, 1)
    Number of events: 54165303.
    Sample duration: 5.00 s.


Now we define a second `Wizard` object with EVT2 encoding and we use its `save()` method to convert the file from DAT to EVT2.


```python
import numpy as np 

wizard_evt2 = Wizard(encoding="evt2")
new_fpath = Path("./spinner_evt2.raw")
wizard_evt2.save(fpath=new_fpath, arr=arr)
```

Let us check that the files are consistent.


```python
new_arr = wizard_evt2.read(new_fpath)

print(f"Durations: DAT = {(arr[-1]['t']-arr[0]['t'])/1e6:.2f} s, \
EVT2 = {(new_arr[-1]['t']-new_arr[0]['t'])/1e6:.2f} s.")

are_equal = True
for coord in ('t', 'x', 'y', 'p'):
    are_equal = are_equal and np.equal(arr[coord], new_arr[coord]).all()

print(f"The two arrays are {'not' if (not are_equal) else ''}identical.")
```

    Durations: DAT = 5.00 s, EVT2 = 5.00 s.
    The two arrays are identical.


There are other methods available in the API. [Check it out!](https://expelliarmus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/expelliarmus/index.html)
